Americans recycled about 68 percent of the paper they used in 2018. This recovered paper is used to make new paper products, which saves trees and other natural resources. Most community or office recycling programs accept paper and paper products. Check what your community or office program accepts before you put it in the bin. Look for products that are made from recycled paper when you shop. Better yet, consider if you really need to print in the first place.","videourl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vLpbQJehcrw"},"spoon":{"image":"https://federalmetals.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/metal-recycling.jpg","desciption":"In 2018, 19.2 million tons of ferrous metals (iron and steel) were generated.
